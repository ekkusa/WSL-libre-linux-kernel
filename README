GNU Linux-libre: <https://www.fsfla.org/selibre/linux-libre/>

This repository contains the GNU Linux-libre release archive.

It is a bit unusual as far as git repositories go, in that it pretty
much does not contain branches, only tags.  The goal is not to reflect
development history, but to preserve our release history in a far more
compact form than a collection of tarballs.

Most tags are initial commits, so that, in case we find releases
containing non-Free Software, we can pull them back without affecting
subsequent releases.

For each release, there are three tags:

- The tag under sources has cleaned-up source tarballs.

- The tag under scripts has the cleaning-up scripts.

- The tag under logs records the modifications made by the scripts,
and GPG signatures of the verified tarballs.
