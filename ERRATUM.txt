This is an erratum, not a release proper, so the usual logs and
signatures are not here.

Unlike releases, this hasn't gone through the release process, it's
just a record of the fix for an error introduced by a cleaning up bug.

The scripts-* patch file holds the change to the cleaning-up scripts.
Applying it to the scripts used to create the release should get you
the corrected scripts, that have been tagged with the erratum identifier.

The sources-* patch file holds the changes the scripts bring about to
the sources.  Applying it to the sources of the release should get you
corrected sources, that have been tagged with the erratum identifier.
